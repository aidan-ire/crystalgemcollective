<h2>F.A.Q's</h2> 
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">How Many Fusions Has Steven Been A Part Of?</h4>
    <p class="answer">With all of the focus that gets placed on Steven's first and arguably main fusion, Stevonnie, it can sometimes be easy to forget just how many other fusions he's been a part of over the years that the show's been running. Steven has actually been a part of six different fusions! There's obviously Stevonnie with Connie, but don't forget Steg, Smoky Quartz, Rainbow Quartz 2.0, Sunstone, and finally Obsidian.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">What Are Steven's Non-Combat Skills?</h4>
    <p class="answer">We spend so much time with Steven as he goes through his training to learn what it truly means to be a Crystal Gem and how he uniquely fits into that team that it's easy to forget he has abilities outside of just his combat powers. For one, Steven is practically a musical prodigy, something he picks up innately from his father, having played the ukelele about as long as he could remember.    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">Just How Tied To His Emotions Are His Powers?</h4>
    <p class="answer">If it'd been a long time since watching the original series when viewing Future, it can be easy to assume that his over-emotional power outbursts came out of nowhere- but that simply isn't true. From the very start of the original series, his powers (and whether or not he could access or control them in the first place) had everything to do with his emotions.

      His shield would only be summoned upon an overwhelming desire to protect others, and his very first time summoning it was triggered by over-excitement, which in turn made it incredibly hard to control. Steven's powers and his emotions have gone hand-in-hand since the beginning, and was the complete opposite of the writers pulling something out of left field.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">How Dangerous Is Fighting For Him?</h4>
    <p class="answer">Since Steven's body is only half-human, he isn't quite at the same risk as an ordinary human when he gets into fights. In the Future episode "Growing Pains", we learn that anytime Steven took a serious hit that would fracture or break some of his bones, they would immediately heal themselves upon contact, so he doesn't actually sustain any of these serious injuries. So physically, he has a pretty big advantage in fights.    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">What Happened To Pink Pearl's Eye?</h4>
    <p class="answer">In the final episodes of Steven Universe, we first meet Pink Pearl as White Diamond's pearl. Under White Diamond's control, we don't see her actual colors until "Change Your Mind." Even then, we still don't learn how her eye got damaged or why she can't simply fix it, like all gems and their injuries.

      All these questions are answered in the Future episode "Volleyball." Along with getting her new name, Volleyball, she also provides an explanation about her eye. She reveals Pink Diamond damaged her eye during a temper tantrum and she can't fix it because of her psychological ties to her former master.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">Where Are The Other Rose Quartzes?</h4>
    <p class="answer">Because the Diamonds believed Pink Diamond was shattered by a Rose Quartz, they had all the other Roses poofed and bubbled. After they learned the truth, the innocent Roses were set free. The episode "Rose Buds" is the first time we not only get to see other Roses, but hear what they sound like.

      Rose/Pink Diamond is played by Susan Egan, but the Roses seen in this episode are played by Kimberly Brooks, who plays Jasper in the series. This answers what Roses look/sound like and it further confirms Pink Diamond was not a Rose.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">Where Did The Universe Name Come From?</h4>
    <p class="answer">Speaking of "Mr. Universe," this is also the episode where we learn why Greg changed his last name to Universe. He reveals that his parents were strict and overbearing. Once he heard a song called "Mr. Universe," it inspired him to hit the road and not turn back.    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h4 class="question">Does Steven Have More Powers?</h4>
    <p class="answer">Steven Universe doesn't start with Steven having access to his powers right away. He develops his shield, bubble, floating powers, and other abilities over time. By the end of the series, it seemed like Steven had discovered everything he could about his abilities. But it left some wondering, is there more Steven's capable of?

      The answer to that is in the very first episode of Future, called "Little Homeschool." Steven gains a new transformation that makes him glow pink and gives him super speed, strength, and a variety of other new abilities. He may have trouble controlling them at first, but it's useful to have powers in his arsenal.</p>
